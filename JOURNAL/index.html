        <p><b>Laurel Schwulst, <i>My Website is a Shifting House ...</i></b></p>
        <p>I really enjoyed Laurel's writing and it opened up my thoughts on what a website can be. My favorite metaphor/section was website as plant since it emphasizes taking time to grow your website and allowing it to figure itself out before it takes full shape. It was also very reassuring to read at the start of this class since viewing complex sites and wanting to create similar stuff but not having the knowledge yet.</p>

        <p><b>Ursula K. Le Guin, <i>A Rant on Technology</i></b></p>
        <p>Ursula's writing was a take on technology I hadn't thought about since the first time reading a few semesters ago. I enjoy the finishing remarks the most in this writing with her stating that there's so many things she doesn't know how to do/build but we can all learn. Again this is reassuring to hear instead of getting overwhelmed by the sheer amount of things that are unknown embrace that they all are possible to learn.</p>

        <p><b>J.R. Carpenter, <i>A Handmade Web</i></b></p>
        <p>The beginning of the reading focuses on older handmade websites in a web that's constantly updating and no longer displays websites like they once did. J.R. terms these past websites not as dead or artifacts but signposts pointing back in time which is a viewpoint I've never thought of. I have always thought things on the internet last forever in some regard but while clicking through links only a handful loaded and were viewable. Another point I enjoyed was the thought of the users hand in websites like the mile long website which required a large amount of scrolling for the user. </p>
